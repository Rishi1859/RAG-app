Title: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine vision.

Modern AI is based on deep learning and large datasets. AI models learn from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Ethics in AI is a growing field of concern. Issues like bias, transparency, and accountability must be addressed.

Overall, AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and education.
